##Model
* Responsible for maintaining the state of the application
* Enforcing business rules

---
##View
* User interface

---
##Controller
* Orchestrate the application (Traffic Cop)

---
#What is REST?
> Representational State Transfer

* Simple set of Verbs that work on each Noun of an application.

---
#What is a 'resource'?
* Simply a controller
* Scaffolding creates a 1 to 1 relationship to model
* Does not need to reflect a model
* Defaults to REST actions

---
#What is 'scaffolding'
* Generated by the ```scaffold``` command
* Generates code based on the attribute notation ```name:string```
* Creates model, view, controller, helper, route, migration and tests
* Has default basic code

---
#Scaffolding

```bash
$ bundle exec rails g scaffold title:string body:text author_id:integer viewable:boolean
```

---
#Scaffolding - Do I need to use that?
^ No you can either use other generators or hand create the files. Scaffolding
generates more than you need most of the time, but it can be a useful learning
tool.

---
##Protip
```bash
$ bundle exec rails g
```

---
#Routes

---
#Example Route

```ruby
DemoApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
end
```

---
#$ rake routes

```
Prefix    Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
users     GET    /users(.:format)               users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)               users#create
new_user  GET    /users/new(.:format)           users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format)      users#edit
users     GET    /users/:id(.:format)           users#show
          PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)           users#destroy
```
^Maps to CRUD actions (index,show,new,create,edit,update,destroy)

---
##PUT vs PATCH
* PATCH is like PUT however PUT works on the full dataset where as PATCH only requires the delta.
* PATCH was defined in 1995 and adopted into Rails in version 4.0

---
