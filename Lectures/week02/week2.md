---
#What is Ruby?

> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

---
#What is Rails
> Ruby on Rails is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.

---
#Ruby version Managers
* Tools to allow you to install several versions of Ruby side by side
* Popular ones are: RVM, rbenv and chruby.

---
#What are Gems (RubyGems)?
>RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.

---
#The Gem command
* ```$ man gem```
* ```$ gem install <gem name> -v=<gem version>```
* ```$ gem list````
* ```$ gem uninstall <gem name>```

---
#Configuration Files
##AKA 'Dot' files

---
#Dot Files
* Start with a ```.``` so they are 'hidden'
* Can be used to configure many applications

---
#.gemrc
```
install: --no-rdoc --no-ri
update:  --no-rdoc --no-ri
```
* This says don't install ri or rdoc when installing a gem
* If you *need* docs locally remove these

---
#```$ rails new```

---
```
$ rails new first_app
      create
      create  README.rdoc
      create  Rakefile
      create  config.ru
      create  .gitignore
      create  Gemfile
      create  app
      create  app/assets/javascripts/application.js
      create  app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
      create  app/controllers/application_controller.rb
      .
      .
      .
      create  vendor/assets/stylesheets/.keep
         run  bundle install
```

---
#Let's explore what files are generated
---
#Instructor opinion
Add the ```--skip-bundle``` flag at the end of your generation command.  It allows your app to be generated and you to make changes before installing gems.

---
#Bundler
>Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as ```bundle install```.

---
#Bundler
Makes use of two files:
* Gemfile
* Gemfile.lock

---
#Gemfile
* A list of all your application's required Gems
* Bundler uses this to manage which Gems to load
* [http://bundler.io/v1.2/man/gemfile.5.html](http://bundler.io/v1.2/man/gemfile.5.html)
* Allows you to group gems for what they are used for ie. Test, Development, Production

---
##Gemfile.lock
* A snapshot from when you run bundle install.
* Not the best idea to modify by hand!

---
#Bundler
* ```$ bundle help```
* ```$ bundle install``` installs gems
* ```$ bundle check``` checks to see if Gemfile is satisfied
* [http://bundler.io/v1.7/commands.html](http://bundler.io/v1.7/commands.html)

---
#Rails server
* ```$ bundle exec rails server ```
