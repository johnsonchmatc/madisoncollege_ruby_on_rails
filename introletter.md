  * EMAIL: You can contact me via email at cgjohnson1@madisoncollege.edu and I will do my very best to get back to you within 24-48 hours. I will do my best to check my email Monday morning through Friday at 4:30pm.
  * PHONE: You can contact me via telephone at 608-301-5232. This is usually not a very efficient method as we will probably end up playing "telephone tag."
  * BLACKBOARD ASSISTANCE: If you experience problems with Blackboard, help is available at the Madison College Library Student Helpdesk. To get help, you can visit room 230 in the library, call 243-4444, or send email to student-help@madisoncollege.edu If you find that Blackboard is "down" and the Student Helpdesk is closed (after hours, weekends, and holidays), you may call 246-6666 to leave a message so it can be addressed as soon as staff is available.

Select your instructor's name from the list of users. Follow directions given for subject line and message. Choose Send Copy of Message to self. Attach the required file by clicking the Add button in Section 4 of the screen; choose Browse to find the attachment, double click on the desired filename, click Submit to add the attachment (repeat this step for each attachment). Click Submit to send the email to your instructor.
