#152 10152157 - 0002 Ruby on Rails Development
##Introduction Letter
Hello all of you Ruby on Rails Developers!!

I am sending you a brief letter to get you going with the Ruby on Rails Development course.  It has a lot of information that is valuable to both online learners and those who are in a traditional classroom setting.

My name is Chris Johnson and I will be your teacher for this face to face learning experience. I am a part-time Information Technology Instructor at Madison College. You can reach me via email at cgjohnson1@madisoncollege.edu. Please read through the following information which clarifies the details of the class.

##Class Structure
This will be a face to face class with a combinations of discussions, lectures, readings and labs. There will be a large amount of work as you will be learning a new language, framework and development methodology. Make sure you come to class prepared each week, doing the readings will prepare  you for the lecture and in class labs.


##Accessing the Class
In order to get started in this class, you need to get to the Blackboard site, which is where our class is located, and log on.
Point your browser to https://blackboard.madisoncollege.edu/webapps/login/
When the Blackboard screen comes up, click login
  Enter the user name and password.
  Your username is typically your First Initial and Last name (example mine would be cgjohnson1). (your username and password should be the same as your email name.)
(If you changed your password last semester, it will be the same as it was at the end of the semester.)

You will see a number of headings including:
  * "My Courses," "Today's Announcements", etc.
  * Click on the words "Ruby on Rails Development" right underneath the "My Courses" heading. This will take you to our class web-site.
  * Your password for Blackboard is the same as the password for your Madison College email.
  * Blackboard requires all students to use their Madison College student email account. However, many students prefer to use a different email address.
  If you wish to use a different address, go into your [student email account](https://mail.madisoncollege.edu/CookieAuth.dll?GetLogon?curl=Z2Fowa&reason=0&formdir=1)and modify your account so that mail is forwarded to the email address that you want to use.


Send me email ASAP if you have difficulty signing on to our Blackboard course cgjohnson1@madisoncollege.edu

###Necessities
* Please note that you MUST have an email address to use this course. Remember that Madison College offers all students a free email address that you can now access email from Madison College’s homepage.
* Access to a computer with a web browser and internet access and the ability to either run a virtual machine or a Ruby on Rails development environment.
* A Heroku.com account, which we will setup in class.
* A Bitbucket.com account, which we will setup in class.

###Assignments
The format of the course is broken down into "weeks". The course will last for 16 weeks and each of these weeks there are various assignments. You will find the outline for the weeks of the  course under the "Classes" section in Blackboard. Weekly assignments include readings, videos, labs, projects and discussions. Please look at the "Classes" section in Blackboard for more detail on the actual assignments.  Due Dates for all assignments are listed in the syllabus.

###Readings & Labs
On the syllabus you will find the schedule for readings and labs. Please come to class having read the chapter and attempted the lab, we will discuss the reading and lab activities.

###Course Project
You will be working on a project during the semester, this project will be something you come up with on your own.  You will need to show your progress three times during the semester, which will give you the ability to get feedback from your me and improve your project.

###Exams
There will be two 'Exams' which are oral presentations. The requirements for each of these will be distributed in class on the first day.

###Socrative
At the end of every class I’ll have you fill out an exit ticket.  The exit ticket is un-graded and my way of taking attendance along with accessing your understanding of the material from the day.  You can login to the site at [http://beta.socrative.com](http://beta.socrative.com) using the room code of "johnsonchmatc"

###Codecaster.io
We'll use [https://codecaster.io/](https://codecaster.io/) in class as a way for you to ask questions or notify me to slowdown with out needing to raise your hand, though the old fashion hand raising still works!

###Development Environment
You will be responsible for your own development environment, we'll set this up during the first class session.  We'll use [http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) as the guide.  I suggest either working in Linux or OS X.  If you are a Windows user I would suggest using a Linux virtual machine, however the choice is yours. You may also use a cloud environment like [https://c9.io](https://c9.io) or [https://www.nitrous.io/](https://www.nitrous.io/).  The first lab will require you to get a local development environment working as an exercise to understand the tools you'll be using.  However during the remainder of the semester use what works for you.

##Ways to Get Help

  * PHONE: You can contact me via telephone at 608-301-5232. This is usually not a very efficient method as we will probably end up playing "telephone tag."
  * BLACKBOARD ASSISTANCE: If you experience problems with Blackboard, help is available at the Madison College Library Student Helpdesk. To get help, you can visit room 230 in the library, call 243-4444, or send email to student-help@madisoncollege.edu If you find that Blackboard is "down" and the Student Helpdesk is closed (after hours, weekends, and holidays), you may call 246-6666 to leave a message so it can be addressed as soon as staff is available.

##Final Thoughts
I look forward to working and learning with you this semester. This is the second semester I have taught this course, so things are subject to change.  Always look to the [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails) site for up to date information, and if you find any errors or something doesn't make sense let me know ASAP so I can fix that.  All items in the course repository are subject to change, will try and notify you of changes and will talk about next weeks readings/labs at the end of each class lecture. It is however your responsibility to stay up to date with the course repository.

To get off to a good start make sure to complete the steps below.

####STEPS TO COMPLETE:

1.	You need to go to our Blackboard site to get a copy of the syllabus which is the place to start so we all have the same expectations.

2.	Check your email often.  I will send you messages on a regular basis.

3.	Access to an internet connection will be needed to turn in assignments, work on labs, and for assignments.

4.	There is an Classes section on our Blackboard site. This contains a folder for each class where I'll post the powerpoint, assignments, labs and related links.

5.	Turning in Assignments: Each lab, project or exam will have specific directions on how to turn that work in.


Looking forward to the semester,


Chris Johnson
